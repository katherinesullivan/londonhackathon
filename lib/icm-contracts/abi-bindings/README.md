## ABI Bindings

This directory contains ABI bindings for the Solidity contracts in the `contracts/` directory. The files with the same name as the Solidity source files are automatically generated by the `scripts/abi_bindings.sh` script.

The `packing.go` files in individual subfolders define utilities for ABI packing instances of structs auto-generated by `abigen` as well as method calls. For structs, the `ABIPacker` interface defined in `./packer/packer.go` needs to be implemented and mapped to its instance added to the `packer_test.go` file to ensure that the tests are exhaustive and don't fail silently if additional fields are added to the structs in the future on the Solidity side.

## Type Mapping Reference

The exhaustiveness testing in `packer_test.go` assumes the following type conversions in it's randomization and only supports setting fields of the Go types listed here. If this changes in the future the test will break and need to be updated.
